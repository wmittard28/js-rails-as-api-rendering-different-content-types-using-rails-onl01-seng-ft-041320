# Rendering Different Content Types in Rails

## Learning Goals

- Override the default Rails view
- Render plain text from a Rails controller
- Render JSON from a Rails controller

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we revisited the default Rails MVC structure, and at the
end, an ERB file was rendered. Rails, however, can render multiple types of
content. In this lesson, we're going to look at some of the content types most
useful to us as we build towards a Rails API.

To follow along, run `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed` to set up your
database and example data.

## Overriding the Default Rails View

Leaving off from the solution of the last lesson, the `index` action rendered all
birds:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
  end
end
```

And we know that this is the same as explicitly stating:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render 'birds/index.html.erb'
  end
end
```

But we aren't restricted to displaying ERB. We can indicate what type
of content we want to render. Let's first look at plain text.

### Render Plain Text From a Controller

To render plain text from a Rails controller, you specify `plain:`, followed by
the text you want to display:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render plain: "Hello #{@birds[3].name}"
  end
end
```

In the browser, this displays as:

```text
Hello Mourning Dove
```

This isn't very fancy, but **_this is actually enough for us to start using our
JavaScript skills and access with a `fetch()` request_**.

To confirm this is working, we need a frontend to send a request to our Rails
app. In this main directory of this code-along, there is an HTML file, `example_frontend.html`, for
this purpose. Follow these steps to see the BirdsController in action:

1. First, replace `BirdsController` with the code above and start up the Rails
   server with `rails s`

2. Second, from this lesson's local directory, in your terminal, type `open
   example_frontend.html`. You should see a webpage open with the text:

    ```text
    This HTML file isn't part of the Rails app. It is here to help you test JS against Rails as you follow along.
    ```

3. While viewing `example_frontend.html`, open the browser console and run the following:

```js
fetch('http://localhost:3000/birds').then(response => response.text()).then(text => console.log(text))
// > Promise {<pending>}
Hello Mourning Dove
```

> **Notice**: On resolution of the `fetch()` request here, in the first
> `.then()`, `response.text()` is called, since we're handling plain text.

We haven't really escaped the MVC structure of Rails, but we're no longer using
the ERB view, nor are we really _viewing_ in the same way we were before.

We've actually requested data, and since it is just plain text, JavaScript can
handle that. But, Rails has one better.

### Render JSON From a Controller

To render _JSON_ from a Rails controller, you specify `json:` followed by data
that can be converted to valid JSON:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: 'Remember that JSON is just object notation converted to string data, so strings also work here'
  end
end
```

We can pass strings as we see above, as well as hashes, arrays, and other data
types:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: { message: 'Hashes of data will get converted to JSON' }
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: ['As','well','as','arrays']
  end
end
```

In our bird watching case, we actually already have a collection of data, `@birds`,
so we can write:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: @birds
  end
end
```

With the Rails server running, check out `http://localhost:3000/birds`. You
should see that Rails has output all the data available from all the `Bird`
records!

```js
[
  {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Black-Capped Chickadee",
      "species": "Poecile Atricapillus",
      "created_at": "2019-05-09T11:07:58.188Z",
      "updated_at": "2019-05-09T11:07:58.188Z"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Grackle",
      "species": "Quiscalus Quiscula",
      "created_at": "2019-05-09T11:07:58.195Z",
      "updated_at": "2019-05-09T11:07:58.195Z"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Common Starling",
      "species": "Sturnus Vulgaris",
      "created_at": "2019-05-09T11:07:58.199Z",
      "updated_at": "2019-05-09T11:07:58.199Z"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "Mourning Dove",
      "species": "Zenaida Macroura",
      "created_at": "2019-05-09T11:07:58.205Z",
      "updated_at": "2019-05-09T11:07:58.205Z"
    }
]
```

Going back to our `example_frontend.html`, we could send another `fetch()`
request to the same place, only this time, since we're handling JSON, we'll swap
out `text()` for `json()`:

```js
fetch('http://localhost:3000/birds').then(response => response.json()).then(object => console.log(object))
// > Promise {<pending>}
 > [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}]

// 0: {id: 1, name: "Black-Capped Chickadee", species: "Poecile Atricapillus", created_at: "2019-05-09T11:07:58.188Z", updated_at: "2019-05-09T11:07:58.188Z"}
// 1: {id: 2, name: "Grackle", species: "Quiscalus Quiscula", created_at: "2019-05-09T11:07:58.195Z", updated_at: "2019-05-09T11:07:58.195Z"}
// 2: {id: 3, name: "Common Starling", species: "Sturnus Vulgaris", created_at: "2019-05-09T11:07:58.199Z", updated_at: "2019-05-09T11:07:58.199Z"}
// 3: {id: 4, name: "Mourning Dove", species: "Zenaida Macroura", created_at: "2019-05-09T11:07:58.205Z", updated_at: "2019-05-09T11:07:58.205Z"}
```

Four birds!

You may also often see more detailed nesting in the `render json:` statement:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: { birds: @birds, messages: ['Hello Birds', 'Goodbye Birds'] }
  end
end
```

Notice that the above would alter the structure of the data being rendered. Rather
than an array of four birds, an object with two keys, each pointing to an array
would be rendered instead. We will explore shaping our data in greater detail in
upcoming lessons, but it is a critical concept to consider.

With the intent of constructing an API, we always want to be thinking about
data. The purpose of an API is to be an accessible _interface_, in our case, to
a JavaScript frontend, so we want to always be thoughtful in how we structure
data and how that data will be utilized.

Well structured API data can make frontend code simpler. Poorly structured API
data can lead to complicated nests of JavaScript enumerables.

## Where is our Data Being Converted to JSON?

When we include an array or hash after `render json:`, it turns out that Rails
is actually being accomodating to us and implicitly handling the work of
converting that array or hash to JSON.

We can choose to explicitly convert our array or hash, without any problem by
adding `to_json` to the end:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: { birds: @birds, messages: ['Hello Birds', 'Goodbye Birds'] }.to_json
  end
end
```

This will produce the same result as it did before. The `to_json` method is
made available to both [arrays][array.to_json] and [hashes][hash.to_json] in Rails,
but is not natively available to them in Ruby. It does exactly what it says - it
takes whatever array or hash it is called on and converts it to JSON.

Rails favors convention as well as a clean and clutter free controller, so it
has some built in 'magic' to handle things like this and keep us from having to
write `to_json` on the same line as `render json:` in every action we write.

## Say Goodbye to Instance Variables

So far in controller actions, we've typically seen instance variables being used,
just as we have in the examples in this lesson:

```rb
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: @birds
  end
end
```

However, we really only needed instance variables when we were rendering to ERB.
Now that we are directly rendering to JSON in the same action, we no longer need
to deal with instance variables and can instead just use a local variable:

```rb
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    birds = Bird.all
    render json: birds
  end
end
```

This is how we will be displaying our examples going forward.

## Conclusion

Let's take a step back and consider what all this means because this is
actually huge! Now that you know that Rails can render JSON, you have the
ability to create entirely independent JavaScript frontends that can communicate
with Rails backends!
